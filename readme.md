Sexy Project Template for Django 1.5
====================================

This is a general-purpose project template for Django. This is my go-to template structure for all of my projects. I've tried to incorporate many Django best practices. This includes:
+ Separating apps and libraries
+ Separating settings based on environment
+ Specifying dependencies based on environment
+ Never storing your secret_key in the repo
+ Using virtualenv
